# Truffle-Test
Very basic project just to test out using Truffle and testing smart contracts. This does not represent anything that would ever be deployed or used outside of this very basic test.

This project simulates someone being able to register a car and someone else being able to rent it. With the glaring security flaws and there not being a cost to renting, this is not something that can be used for any applications in its current state. This was just done to try out using Truffle.
